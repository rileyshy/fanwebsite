                <li>Science provides explanations for many natural phenomena, but it does not necessarily disprove the existence of God.</li>
                <li>Many people find that belief in God gives them a sense of purpose and answers to existential questions that science does not address.</li>
                <li>Different philosophical arguments, like the teleological argument, aim to demonstrate the reasonableness of belief in God through observed evidence in the world.</li>
