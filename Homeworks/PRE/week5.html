    <h1>Week 5: PRE Homework</h1>
    <h2>Reasons to support the Big Bang theory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is like the leftover heat from the Big Bang. It's spread all over the universe and matches what scientists predicted.</li>
        <li>Galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther they are, the faster they move. This means the universe is expanding, which fits the Big Bang idea.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reasons to support the creation story in Genesis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Believing in the Genesis creation story can strengthen a sense of community and shared identity among those who hold these beliefs.</li>
        <li>The Genesis story is a foundational text in many cultures, shaping their history, literature, and values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reasons against the Big Bang theory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some scientists and theorists propose alternative models like the Steady State Theory or cyclic models, which offer different explanations for the universe's origins.</li>
        <li>The lack of a complete theory of quantum gravity means we can't fully understand the very earliest moments of the Big Bang.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reasons against the creation story in Genesis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a lack of archaeological and historical evidence to support some of the specific events described in the Genesis creation story.</li>
        <li>Some people point out contradictions within the Bible itself, including differences between the two creation accounts in Genesis chapters 1 and 2.</li>
    </ul>
