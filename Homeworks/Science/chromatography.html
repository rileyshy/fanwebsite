    <h1>Chromatography Experiment</h1>

    <p>Chromatography is used to separate mixtures. It involves a mobile phase and one other phase.</p>

    <div class="question">
        (a) What is the other phase in chromatography? Tick (âœ“) one box.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled> Moving phase<br>
        <input type="checkbox" disabled> Recycled phase<br>
        <input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Stationary phase<br>
        <input type="checkbox" disabled> Viscous phase
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        (b) Why do the substances in the mixture separate in the mobile phase?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Substances in the mixture separate in the mobile phase because they stick to the stationary phase differently. Some substances stick more and move slower, while others stick less and move faster. This difference in how they move causes them to separate as they travel through the chromatography setup.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        (c) How many spots will be produced on the chromatogram of a pure compound?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Number of spots = A pure compound will produce one spot on the chromatogram.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        (d) In a chromatography experiment, a blue colour moved 4.77 cm. The solvent moved 5.30 cm. Calculate the Rf value for the blue colour.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        So, the Rf value for the blue color is approximately 0.90. <br>
        Rf value = 0.90

        (e) Black ink is a mixture of several colours. Plan an experiment using paper chromatography to:
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To separate and identify the different colors present in black ink using paper chromatography, you can set up an experiment as follows: Begin by cutting a strip of chromatography paper and drawing a faint baseline near the bottom with a pencil. Place a small dot of black ink onto the baseline. Next, place the paper in a container with a small amount of solvent, such as water or a water:ethanol mixture, ensuring the ink dot is above the solvent level. Allow the solvent to move up the paper by capillary action, which will separate the ink into its component colors. Once the solvent front approaches the top of the paper, remove the paper and mark the solvent front with a pencil. Measure and record the distance from the baseline to each separated color spot, as well as the total distance traveled by the solvent. Calculate the Rf value for each color using the formula Rf = (distance moved by the substance) / (distance moved by the solvent). Compare these Rf values with known values for different colors to tentatively identify each color present in the black ink. Repeat the experiment with different solvents or ink samples to optimize separation and identification. This method allows you to effectively analyze the composition of black ink and identify its individual color components using simple chromatographic techniques.
